## 📡 1. What is an API?

**API** stands for **Application Programming Interface**.

### 🧠 Definition:

> An API is a set of rules that allow software applications to communicate with each other.

- Think of it as a **contract** between client and server.
- APIs define **what data** can be requested or sent, and **how**.

---

## 🌍 2. What is a REST API?

**REST** = **Representational State Transfer**
Created by **Roy Fielding** in 2000.

### 🧠 Definition:

> A REST API is an API that follows the architectural style of REST, using standard HTTP methods and resources.

### Characteristics:

- It is **stateless**.
- It uses **standard HTTP methods** (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.).
- Data is typically exchanged in **JSON** or **XML**.
- It is **resource-based** (uses nouns like `/users`, not verbs like `/getUsers`).

## 📜 3. Principles of REST API (6 REST Constraints)

To be considered RESTful, an API must follow **6 constraints**:

---

### 🔒 1. **Client–Server**

- Separation of concerns:

  - **Client** handles the UI/UX.
  - **Server** handles data, logic, and storage.

📌 Benefits: Enables independent evolution of client and server.

---

### ❌ 2. **Stateless**

- Each request from client to server must contain **all the information** needed.
- Server does **not store session state**.

📌 Benefits: Scalable, easier to cache, test, and restart.

---

### 🧱 3. **Cacheable**

- Responses must define whether they are **cacheable** or not using HTTP headers.
- Helps reduce load and improve speed.

📌 Example:

```http
Cache-Control: no-cache
```

---

### 🔄 4. **Uniform Interface**

- One of REST's **core features**.
- Means: A consistent way to interact with resources.

Key elements:

- Resources are identified using **URIs** (`/users`, `/products`)
- Use **standard HTTP methods**
- Responses should include **hypermedia links (HATEOAS)** _(optional in most practical REST APIs)_

---

### 🔌 5. **Layered System**

- APIs can have multiple layers:

  - Security
  - Load balancing
  - Proxy or gateway

Clients should not know if they’re talking to the final server or an intermediary.

---

### 🧪 6. **Code on Demand** _(optional)_

- The server can return **executable code**, like JavaScript, to the client.
- Rarely used in REST APIs.

---

## 📮 4. HTTP Methods (Verbs)

These methods define **what action** the client wants to perform on the resource.

| HTTP Method | Action         | Description                        |
| ----------- | -------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `GET`       | Read           | Fetch resource(s)                  |
| `POST`      | Create         | Add a new resource                 |
| `PUT`       | Update/Replace | Replace entire resource            |
| `PATCH`     | Partial Update | Update part of the resource        |
| `DELETE`    | Delete         | Remove a resource                  |
| `HEAD`      | Meta-info      | Like GET, but returns headers only |
| `OPTIONS`   | Capabilities   | Lists supported HTTP methods       |

---

### 🌐 Examples

- `GET /users`: Fetch all users
- `GET /users/1`: Fetch user with ID = 1
- `POST /users`: Create new user
- `PUT /users/1`: Replace user with ID = 1
- `PATCH /users/1`: Update part of user 1
- `DELETE /users/1`: Delete user 1

---

## ✅ 5. REST API Best Practices

### 1. **Use nouns, not verbs**

✅ `/users`
❌ `/getUsers`

### 2. **Use plural for resources**

✅ `/users`
❌ `/user`

### 3. **Use consistent structure**

- `/resources`
- `/resources/:id`
- `/resources/:id/subresources`

### 4. **Use proper HTTP status codes**

| Code | Meaning               |
| ---- | --------------------- |
| 200  | OK                    |
| 201  | Created               |
| 204  | No Content            |
| 400  | Bad Request           |
| 401  | Unauthorized          |
| 403  | Forbidden             |
| 404  | Not Found             |
| 500  | Internal Server Error |

### 5. **Use filtering, sorting, and pagination via query params**

```http
GET /users?page=2&limit=20&sortBy=name&order=asc
```

### 6. **Use JSON for request/response bodies**

### 7. **Document your API (Swagger/OpenAPI)**
