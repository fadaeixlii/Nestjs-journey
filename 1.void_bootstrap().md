```ts
void bootstrap();
```

This is **not** defining the function — it's **calling** the `bootstrap` function and using `void` before it.

---

## ✅ What does `void bootstrap()` mean in this context?

It means:

> "Call the `bootstrap()` function, and intentionally ignore any returned value, especially if it returns a Promise."

---

### 🧠 Why use `void`?

In NestJS and other async TypeScript setups, your `bootstrap()` function is typically `async`. For example:

```ts
async function bootstrap() {
  await app.listen(3000);
}
```

If you just call it like:

```ts
bootstrap();
```

Then **any unhandled errors inside the async function** could get lost or trigger a warning like:

> "Unhandled promise rejection."

Using:

```ts
void bootstrap();
```

means:

> "I’m intentionally not awaiting this async function — I’m discarding its Promise — and I won’t handle its result."

---

### ⚠️ Without `void`, TypeScript or linters might warn:

If you're using ESLint with `@typescript-eslint/no-floating-promises`, it will warn if you call an async function without `await` or `void`.

## ✅ Summary

| Code                 | Meaning                                                 |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `bootstrap();`       | Call it, but maybe unsafe if it's async.                |
| `await bootstrap();` | Wait for it to finish — must be in an async function.   |
| `void bootstrap();`  | Call it and **explicitly ignore** the returned Promise. |

---

### 🚀 NestJS recommends:

```ts
// main.ts
async function bootstrap() {
  const app = await NestFactory.create(AppModule);
  await app.listen(3000);
}
void bootstrap();
```

So you're safe from unhandled promise errors and satisfy ESLint rules.

Let me know if you want to handle errors explicitly (e.g., with a try/catch in `bootstrap`).
